# REST API IN lambda (Node.js)
This project is a collection of code that demonstrates how to create a REST API using AWS Lambda. 

No need to use express in lambda.By using this project folder structure any one can start creating REST api in Lambda.

The code in this repository will show you how to create a Lambda function that can be triggered by an HTTP request and return a response to the client. You will learn how to define the API endpoints and the Lambda function logic, as well as how to deploy the API to AWS.

I hope this repository will be helpful to those who are new to building REST APIs with Lambda and are looking for a starting point. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for visiting.
